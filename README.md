# SHAP-Method-for-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System(Smart Devices and IoT)


## Building robust algorthim using Data Mining - SHAP method and Random Forest Classifier

This project, with a background and rationale to Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) with smart devices and Internet of Things the main focus giving the uprise in the amount data living out there and the urgent resolution to detect attacks as soon as possible and accurately, gives review of the Machine learning approach, deep learning approach, and SHAP method on NIDS. The methodology discuss the framework of the project, the data preparation necessary, and the project implementation procedure clearly. The results from the implementation procedure were discussed and compared the project's Random Forest Classifier and the SHAP method for Network Intrusion Detection Systems evaluation metrics. 

This project is aimed to answer the following questions;
* What are the most important features in the prediction of Network Intrusion?
* How significantly did the SHAP method impact the classification of threats?
* Did the new framework (SHAP) do better than the state-of-the-art methods?

## The algorithm to using this framework is as follows;
* Create target dataset
* Apply Random Forest Classifier
* Apply SHAP method
* Retrain with RFC algorithm
* Evaluate model with confusion matrix

## The project is still work in progress and I am finding ways to optimise the project.
